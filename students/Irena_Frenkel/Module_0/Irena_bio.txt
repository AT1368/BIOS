Hello! I’m Irena. I’m a student in the MPH in Applied Biostatistics program

 at the Colorado School for Public Health. While in school, I have continued 
 
 to work as a clinical microbiologist in a hospital lab, but soon after 
 
 graduating, I plan to pivot to a career in public health data science.  
 
 I grew up in Aurora, Colorado and some of my hobbies include backpacking, 

 snowboarding, and rock climbing.
